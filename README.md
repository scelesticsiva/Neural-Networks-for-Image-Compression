### Description
In this project, we investigated different types of neural networks on the image compression problem.
We divide the problem into two parts

### 1. Lossless Compression

We used a MLP based predictive coding for the lossless compression.
Details of the algorithm can be found in the [report](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/blob/master/report.pdf)

The codes and instructions on how to run can be found in [MLP_lossless](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/tree/master/MLP_lossless)

### 1. Lossy Compression

For the lossy compresison, we tried three different architectures.
Details,results and some exmaples of all of them can be found in the [report](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/blob/master/report.pdf)
The codes and instructions on how to run can be found in the following folders
- [Autoencoders](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/tree/master/Autoencoders)
- [GAN](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/tree/master/Autoencoders)
- [GAN-AE](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Neural-Networks-for-Image-Compression/tree/master/Autoencoders)
